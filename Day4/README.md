> ## Strings

A String is basically a sequence of characters. A String is instantiated as follows:-

    String name;
    name = new String("Manjunath");

String is a class but can also be used as a datatype. Hence it can be used as:-

    String name = "Manjunath";

### Strings are Immutable and cannot be changed.
