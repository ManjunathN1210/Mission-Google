## Basics of JAVA

#### Differences between Java and C++


|       **Parameters**      | **Java**                                                             | **C++**                                                        |
|:-------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Founder**               | **James Gosling at Sun MicroSystems**                                | **Bjarne Strastrup at Bell Labs**                              |
| **First Release**         | **1995**                                                             | **1985**                                                       |
| **Platform Dependency**   | Platform independent , Java bytecode can run on any operating system |  Platform dependent, should be compiled on different platforms |
| **Portable**              | It can run on any OS hence it is portable                            | C++ is platform dependent. Hence, it is not portable           |
| **Compilation**           | Java is both a compiled and interpreted language                     | C++ is a compilation language                                  |
| **Memory Management**     | Memory Management is System Controlled                               | Memory Management in C++ is manual                             |
| **Multiple Inheritance**  | Java does not support multiple inheritance                           | C++ supports multiple inheritance                              |
| **Pointers**              | Java has very limited support for pointers                           | C++ strongly supports pointers                                 |
| **Language Type**         | Java is an object oriented language                                  | C++ is both a procedural and object oriented language          |
| **Structures and Unions** | Java doesnt support structures and unions                            | C++ supports Structures and Unions                             |

### Syntax of JAVA

#### Basic Terminologies of Java

1. **Class**:- The class is a blueprint(plan) of the instance of the class(object). It can be defined as a template that describes the data and behaviour associated with its instance.
        Ex:- Blueprint of the house is class.

2. **Object**:- The object is an instance of the class. It is an entity that has behaviour and state. 
        Ex:- A car is an object whose states are:- brand, color and number plate.
             **Behaviour**:- Driving on the road.

3. **Method**:- The behaviour of the object is the method.
        Ex:- Fuel indicator indicates the amount of fuel left in the car.

4. **Instance Variables**:- Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The state of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.
