## Basics of JAVA

> **Differences between Java and C++**

|       **Parameters**      | **Java**                                                             | **C++**                                                        |
|:-------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Founder**               | **James Gosling at Sun MicroSystems**                                | **Bjarne Strastrup at Bell Labs**                              |
| **First Release**         | **1995**                                                             | **1985**                                                       |
| **Platform Dependency**   | Platform independent , Java bytecode can run on any operating system |  Platform dependent, should be compiled on difrent platforms |
| **Portable**              | It can run on any OS hence it is portable                            | C++ is platform dependent. Hence, it is not portable           |
| **Compilation**           | Java is both a compiled and interpreted language                     | C++ is a compilation language                                  |
| **Memory Management**     | Memory Management is System Controlled                               | Memory Management in C++ is manual                             |
| **Multiple Inheritance**  | Java does not support multiple inheritance                           | C++ supports multiple inheritance                              |
| **Pointers**              | Java has very limited support for pointers                           | C++ strongly supports pointers                                 |
| **Language Type**         | Java is an object oriented language                                  | C++ is both a procedural and object oriented language          |
| **Structures and Unions** | Java doesnt support structures and unions                            | C++ supports Structures and Unions                             |

### **Syntax of JAVA**

> **Basic Terminologies of Java**

1. **Class**:- The class is a blueprint(plan) of the instance of the class(object). It can be defined as a template that describes the data and behaviour associated with its instance.
        Ex:- Blueprint of the house is class.

2. **Object**:- The object is an instance of the class. It is an entity that has behaviour and state. 
        Ex:- A car is an object whose states are:- brand, color and number plate.
             **Behaviour**:- Driving on the road.

3. **Method**:- The behaviour of the object is the method.
        Ex:- Fuel indicator indicates the amount of fuel left in the car.

4. **Instance Variables**:- Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The state of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.

> #### Literals in Java

A Literal is a constant value which can be assigned to a variable.
Ex:- int age = 56;

> #### DataTypes in Java

1. **byte** :- byte age = 34;
2. **int** :- int value = 10;
3. **short** :- short height = 12;
4. **long** :- long Dino = 29296482l;
5. **char** :- char ch = 'A';
6. **float** :- float f1 = 5.6f;
7. **double** :- double d1 = 4.564;
8. **boolean** :- boolean yes = true/false;
      
> #### Keywords in Java
These are the words that are reserved by the compiler and cannot be used as an identifier.

| **abstract** | **continue** |     **for**    |   **switch**  |      **new**     |
|:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|
|  **assert**  |  **default** |    **goto**    |  **package**  | **synchronized** |
|  **boolean** |    **do**    |     **if**     |  **private**  |     **this**     |
|   **break**  |  **double**  | **implements** | **protected** |     **throw**    |
|   **byte**   |   **else**   |   **import**   |   **public**  |    **throws**    |
|   **case**   |   **enum**   | **instanceof** |   **return**  |   **transient**  |
|   **catch**  |  **extends** |     **int**    |   **short**   |      **try**     |
|   **char**   |   **final**  |  **interface** |   **static**  |     **void**     |
|   **class**  |  **finally** |    **long**    |  **strictfp** |   **volatile**   |
|   **const**  |   **float**  |   **native**   |   **super**   |     **while**    |

> ### User Input Function in Java

Scanner class can be made use to accept user input from users. One has to import Scanner class from java.lang in order to accept user inputs.
[Click here to view program to accept user input](https://github.com/manjunathnmessi/Mission-Google/blob/master/Day2/Programs/Basic_Program.java)

> ### Practice Work 1:- Write a program to add two numbers with input taken from user.

Once after trying to write your own program [check this](https://github.com/manjunathnmessi/Mission-Google/blob/master/Day2/Programs/Sum_Two_Numbers.java)

### Ah, thats for DAY2 -> let's have more fun on [DAY3](https://github.com/manjunathnmessi/Mission-Google/tree/master/Day3)
