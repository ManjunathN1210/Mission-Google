# Mission-Google
##### To help myself accomplish as a Software Developer to get into google

This is a self observation process of identifying the time that would take to learn java.

So, thought it would be good to record all changes that happen in this jounery of learning java for placements.

This is my 12 Days Journey of Java Programming
