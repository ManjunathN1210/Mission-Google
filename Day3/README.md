### Operators and Expressions 

Operators are used to perform operations on variables or values. 

> ### Types of Operators

1. **Arithmetic Operators** :- These are used to perform some of the arithmetic operations like -> +,-,*,/,%,++,-- ( Arithmetic Operators cannot work with boolean values ).
2. **Comparison Operators** :- These are used to compare two values -> ==, >=, <=
3. **Logical Operators** :- These are used to perform some of the logical operations like -> &&, || , !
4. **Assignment Operators** :- These are used to assign value to a variable -> = , +=, -=
5. **BitWise Operators** :- These are used to perform Bitwise operation -> 

> ### Precedence of Operators

Easiest way to remember the precedence order is

    P - Parenthesis(1)
    E - Exponential(1)
    M - Multiplication(2)
    D - Division(2)
    A - Addition(3)
    S - Subtraction(3)
    PEMDAS

The Precedence of the operators are decided in the order from Left to Right if there is a clash between two operators with same precedence.

++ and = associativity order is from Right to Left.

> #### Examples
    int x = 6;
    int y = 12;
    int k = x * (y/2); 
    
    Output:- 36

> ### DataTypes of Expressions 

Resulting data type after arithmetic operation
| **Result** |  byte |  short |   **int**  |
|:----------:|:-----:|:------:|:----------:|
| **Result** | short |   int  |   **int**  |
| **Result** |  long |  float |  **float** |
| **Result** |  int  |  float |  **float** |
| **Result** |  char |   int  |   **int**  |
| **Result** |  char |  short |   **int**  |
| **Result** |  long | double | **double** |
| **Result** | float | double | **double** |

> ### Increment and Decrement Operators

a++, ++a -> Increment Operator
a--, --a -> Decrement Operator

i++ always tells to print first and then increment a variable
++i always tells to increment first and then print the value of the variable.

    int i = 56;
    int b = i++;  //first b is assigned i (56) and then i is incremented (57)
    int j = 67;
    int c = ++i; //first j is incremented (68) and then j is assigned to c (68)

> ### Practice Work 4:- What will be the value of the following expression. Find the value of x

    int y = 7;
    int x = ++y*8;
    System.out.println(x)

    //Output:- 64

### Practice Work 5:- What is the result of the following expression -> float a = 7/4 * 9/2
