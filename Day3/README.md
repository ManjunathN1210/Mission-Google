### Operators and Expressions 

Operators are used to perform operations on variables or values. 

> ### Types of Operators

1. **Arithmetic Operators** :- These are used to perform some of the arithmetic operations like -> +,-,*,/,%,++,-- ( Arithmetic Operators cannot work with boolean values ).
2. **Comparison Operators** :- These are used to compare two values -> ==, >=, <=
3. **Logical Operators** :- These are used to perform some of the logical operations like -> &&, || , !
4. **Assignment Operators** :- These are used to assign value to a variable -> = , +=, -=
5. **BitWise Operators** :- These are used to perform Bitwise operation -> 

> ### Precedence of Operators

Easiest way to remember the precedence order is
**P** - Parenthesis(1)
**E** - Exponential(1)
**M** - Multiplication(2)
**D** - Division(2)
**A** - Addition(3)
**S** - Subtraction(3)

**PEMDAS**
The Precedence of the operators are decided in the order from Left to Right if there is a clash between two operators with same precedence.

++ and = associativity order is from Right to Left.

> #### Examples
    int x = 6;
    int y = 12;
    int k = x * (y/2); -> Output:- 36

> ### DataTypes of Expressions 

Resulting data type after arithmetic operation
| **Result** |  byte |  short |   **int**  |
|:----------:|:-----:|:------:|:----------:|
| **Result** | short |   int  |   **int**  |
| **Result** |  long |  float |  **float** |
| **Result** |  int  |  float |  **float** |
| **Result** |  char |   int  |   **int**  |
| **Result** |  char |  short |   **int**  |
| **Result** |  long | double | **double** |
| **Result** | float | double | **double** |
